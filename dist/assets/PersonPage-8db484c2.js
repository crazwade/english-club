The journey had just begun.\r
\r
Day 1-3: Exploring Stockholm Stockholm, an enchanting city spread across 14 islands, is a fantastic blend of modernity and rich history. The cobblestone streets of Gamla Stan, the city’s old town, transported me back in time, while the modern district of Södermalm offered trendy boutiques and a vibrant nightlife. A visit to the Vasa Museum, home to a 17th-century ship, was a highlight.\r
\rDay 4-6: Drive to Gothenburg The drive to Gothenburg was scenic and peaceful. Sweden’s second-largest city welcomed me with its Dutch-style canals and leafy boulevards. The Universeum, a science center with a rainforest, aquarium, and animals, was a hit.\r
\r
Day 7-9: Venturing into Norway Crossing the border into Norway, the landscape changed dramatically. Majestic fjords and towering mountains replaced the gentle hills of Sweden. Oslo, Norway’s capital, was a delightful mix of old and new. The Viking Ship Museum was a must-see, and the view from the Holmenkollen Ski Jump was breathtaking.\r
\r
Day 10-12: The Fjords of Norway Driving along Norway’s west coast was an unforgettable experience. The Geirangerfjord and the Nærøyfjord, both UNESCO World Heritage sites, were stunningly beautiful. A ferry ride across the fjords was a unique experience that allowed me to appreciate the scale and beauty of these natural wonders.\r
\r
Day 13-15: Return to Sweden The drive back to Sweden was filled with reflection on the incredible journey. The cities, the countryside, the fjords - each had a unique charm that would linger in my memory.\r
\r
This self-drive tour through Sweden and Norway was more than just a holiday. It was an adventure that offered a wealth of experiences - from cosmopolitan cities to stunning natural landscapes. It was a journey that I would recommend to anyone seeking a unique travel experience.`};await x(a.files),s.value=a.files,n.value=h(a.content),o.value=!1;return}};return L(()=>{T()}),(e,a)=>{const w=l("el-slider"),p=l("el-card"),V=l("el-skeleton-item"),N=l("el-skeleton"),D=l("el-image");return d(),m(S,null,[c(C,{visible:t.visible,type:t.type,msg:t.msg,title:t.title,onClose:I},null,8,["visible","type","msg","title"]),f("div",z,[c(w,{modelValue:r.value,"onUpdate:modelValue":a[0]||(a[0]=g=>r.value=g)},null,8,["modelValue"])]),i.value>5?(d(),m("div",{key:0,class:"containerPost",style:b({height:`${i.value}%`})},[c(p,{class:"overflow-auto"},{default:k(()=>[f("div",{class:"card-content",innerHTML:n.value},null,8,A)]),_:1})],4)):j("",!0),y.value>5?(d(),m("div",{key:1,class:"containerPost",style:b({height:`${y.value}%`})},[f("div",O,[c(N,{style:{width:"240px"},loading:o.value,animated:"",count:3},{template:k(()=>[c(V,{variant:"image",style:{width:"400px",height:"267px"}})]),_:1},8,["loading"]),(d(!0),m(S,null,E(s.value,(g,q)=>(d(),U(D,{key:q,src:g,"preview-src-list":s.value,fit:"cover",lazy:!0},null,8,["src","preview-src-list"]))),128))])],4)):j("",!0)],64)}}});const Q=$(R,[["__scopeId","data-v-39d15645"]]);export{Q as default};
